# Rust Coding Challenges

This repository contains all the coding challenges I solved using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

The problems I try to solve come from different sources:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)

## Tests

Every solution is backed by tests. To test the `leetcode` problems run:

```sh
cargo test leetcode

```

## Binaries

Most of the code in this repository is not used in any binary but there are exceptions:

You can run the first Chapter [Fly.io Distributed Systems Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) with:
```
cargo run flyio-1
```
